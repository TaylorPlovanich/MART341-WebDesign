## Web Browser Function
- Web browsers fetch, interpret, and display web content. When you enter a URL, the browser makes a request to a web server, retrieves the files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and renders the webpage using a rendering engine.
  
- User Input: The user types a URL or clicks a link.
DNS Lookup: The browser retrieves the IP address of the server hosting the requested webpage through the Domain Name System (DNS).
Request & Response: The browser sends a request to the server, which replies with the necessary files.
Rendering: The browser uses a rendering engine to parse the HTML, build the DOM, apply styles (CSS), and run JavaScript.
Displaying: The browser then displays the fully rendered page to the user.

## The DOM (Document Object Model)
- The DOM is a structured tree of HTML elements. It allows JavaScript to modify and interact with a webpage by treating elements as nodes that can be accessed and changed.
  
## HTML, XML, XHTML
- HTML: The most widely-used web language, HTML structures page content and allows for stylesheets and scripts. It's flexible but can vary in quality across browsers.
  
XML: Unlike HTML, XML describes document nodes for data sharing and transport. It doesnâ€™t render anything but allows data to update without page reloads.

XHTML: A stricter version of HTML that follows XML standards. It ensures accurate markup, is more precise, but takes longer to write and maintain, especially for mobile devices.

## Essential Elements of an HTML Page
- <!DOCTYPE html>: Defines HTML5.
<html>: Root of the document.
<head>: Meta info and links.
<body>: Visible content.

## The index.html Page
- index.html is the default page served when visiting a website. It should be placed in the root directory of your website.

## Clean and Organized Code
- Use descriptive, meaningful names.
- Be consistent and avoid special characters or generic terms.
