## Nature and Wildlife Observation Journal

I've chosen to develop the Wildlife Observation Journal site because it combines my passion for nature and writing/storytelling, which should create a unique blend. The site will encourage users to not only document their wildlife obervations, but also express their experiencrs through art, photos and persoanl narratives. I plan to use a calm, nature-inspired tone and style, with earthy colors, and a clean, inviting design to create a space that feels both engaging and peaceful.

## Notes

1. Balance Concepts and Layout Improvements

In this project, I applied several balance concepts by adjusting the width and background color of various elements. By setting specific widths for images and text sections, I ensured that the layout felt harmonious and visually appealing. For instance, I utilized a consistent width for images (33% for a 3x3 image layout in my collage section) to maintain alignment and proportion. Additionally, choosing a light background color (like a beige) helped create contrast with the text and images,readability and visuals. 

2. Final Design vs. Initial Idea

Initially, my design concept was more straightforward. I knew I wanted a large picture at the beginning to greet, or grab the attention, of the user. Also, when I looked at your code example for your site, I also checked out your website design, and it was pretty much the same idea I had, except yours was better organized. I really enjoy the colors and textures of the first image I posted. Not sure what will happen during the remainder of this course, but I think it would be great to incorporate the wood as the background, and have the images and texts be pinned to it, like  with thumb tacks or something. Like a bulletin board.

I also found that using CSS properties like margins and floats helped distribute space evenly. While my final layout retained the core elements of my initial idea, I made several adjustments, such as adding a wildlife collage and modifying image sizes, which enhanced the overall balance of the design.

3. Experiments with Float and Margin

I experimented with float and margin properties to position images and text within my layout. Initially, I floated images to the left and right of the text just to see how things would look. I looked at the code example you gave to see how it was done.

4. Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges I faced was achieving a balanced layout while ensuring that all content was accessible and visually appealing. I struggled with aligning images and text properly, especially in the collage section. I knew it had to be included in the style section to reference later on, with things like width and alignment, but I struggled. I finally gave up and googled it. Watched a youtube video.
