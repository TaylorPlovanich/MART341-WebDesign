## Nature and Wildlife Observation Journal

I've chosen to develop the Wildlife Observation Journal site because it combines my passion for nature and writing/storytelling, which should create a unique blend. The site will encourage users to not only document their wildlife obervations, but also express their experiencrs through art, photos and persoanl narratives. I plan to use a calm, nature-inspired tone and style, with earthy colors, and a clean, inviting design to create a space that feels both engaging and peaceful.

## Notes

1. Balance Concepts and Layout Improvements

In this project, I applied several balance concepts by adjusting the width and background color of various elements. By setting specific widths for images and text sections, I ensured that the layout felt harmonious and visually appealing. For instance, I utilized a consistent width for images (33% for a 3x3 image layout in my collage section) to maintain alignment and proportion. Additionally, choosing a light background color (like a beige) helped create contrast with the text and images,readability and visuals. 

2. Final Design vs. Initial Idea

Initially, my design concept was more straightforward, with less emphasis on visual hierarchy and balance. However, as I progressed, I realized that incorporating elements like images, quotes, and a collage significantly enriched the overall aesthetic and user experience. The final design exceeded my expectations in terms of balance; I found that using CSS properties like margins and floats helped distribute space evenly. While my final layout retained the core elements of my initial idea, I made several adjustments, such as adding a wildlife collage and modifying image sizes, which enhanced the overall balance of the design.

3. Experiments with Float and Margin

I experimented with float and margin properties to position images and text within my layout. Initially, I floated images to the left and right of the text just to see how things would look. 

4. Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges I faced was achieving a balanced layout while ensuring that all content was accessible and visually appealing. I struggled with aligning images and text properly, especially in the collage section. I knew it had to be included in the style section to reference later on, with things like width and alignment, but I struggled. I finally gave up and googled it. Watched a youtube video.
