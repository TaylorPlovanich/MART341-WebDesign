## Wildlife Observation Journal

I've chosen to develop the Wildlife Observation Journal site because it combines my passion for nature and writing/storytelling, which should create a unique blend. The site will encourage users to not only document their wildlife obervations, but also express their experiencrs through art, photos and persoanl narratives. I plan to use a calm, nature-inspired tone and style, with earthy colors, and a clean, inviting design to create a spcae that feels both engaging and peaceful.
